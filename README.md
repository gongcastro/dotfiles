# setup

This is my custom setup for Linux machines (Ubuntu >= 22)

Run the following line of code:

```bash
wget -O $HOME/setup.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gongcastro/setup/main/setup.sh | bash
``````

This will download custom scripts, fonts, and themes. It will also install my preferred software and its system dependencies:

- GNOME tweaks
- Git and GitHub client (`gh`)
- R
- Rstudio
- Quarto
- Python
- Julia
- NeoVim
- Praat
- Audacity
- Docker
- Zotero
- MySQL
- Zoom
- VS Code with radian and several linters
- Oh My Posh with custom theme
